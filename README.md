# StereoNet
Customized implementation of the [Stereonet guided hierarchical refinement for real-time edge-aware depth prediction](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Sameh_Khamis_StereoNet_Guided_Hierarchical_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf)

Modified from [zhixuanli](https://github.com/zhixuanli/StereoNet)'s version to generate (and train with) both left and right disparity maps. Also some bugfixes and alterations to training.
